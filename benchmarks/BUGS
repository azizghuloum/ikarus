* maze needs bitwise-and
* quicksort needs bignum modulo.
* scheme needs complex? and other stuff.
* slatex needs char-alphabetic?
* compiler needs string-downcase

* ntakl kinda slow
* string too slow
* nbody does not work

* fibfp does not terminate
* mbrot too slow
* pnpoly kinda slow
* sumfp/fpsum too slow

BUG:
* (exact->inexact (/ (expt 2 3000) (- (expt 2 3000) 1)))
  should return 1.0, not +nan.0.

* fxsra does not work for large numbers

* pretty-print goes into infinite loop on cyclic data
* set! on global names is not working.
* Ensure immutable exports

======================================================================

* FIXED symbol calls are not checking for non-procedure.


* FIX: Error in generate-code: BUG: unhandles single rv.





Not applicable anymore:

* In libcompile.ss:
  If you move the (initialize-system) call to the very bottom of the
  library, the system crashes on startup.  





Fixed:

* Investigate what happens when an interrupt occurs during a write.
